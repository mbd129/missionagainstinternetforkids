#obviously internet is not kind to a lot of people
#one being me i have realized its effects
#when i was mass cyberbullied by some moralistic people (me included lol)
#this was actually a very bad experience
#i would have a need to block them'
#but everywhere i block them i get some problems
#this has made me in a loop of hurting myself and the communication difficulties with this group has resulted a toxic echo chamber
#where their actions have felt like my existence as threat to theirs and this has been felt like a push for me to suicide
# and  blame on me for their hurt which caused by their
#ego to not communicate with me
#i was depressed hurt devastated
#i lost lot of money, i am in medication and reading a lot of philosophy which i actually enjoyed to some extent
#i realized the negative effects of the internet in a very hard way
#i have downloaded many apps chrome extensions
#would find bugs in apps
#like i paid blocker x subscription it has everything right but if we remove a permission it stops working and money is lost
#chrome extensions dont work on guest mode 
#disabling guest after wards we can enable guest mode
#only option felt like leave everything run to himalayas or hurt them or SUICIDE
#i am very aware of toxicity of internet and i feel its more hurtful for children
#i am starting slow but will try and go in that direction
#this december i think i could maybe install atleast 500 family link apps in kids phones (as i am a volunteer at rkmath balavikas hyd)
#to make it possible is the first step
